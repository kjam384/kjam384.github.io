I'm a mechatronics engineer with a considerable interest electro-mechanical systems and software design. I have experience in ROS, Gazebo, and Arduino. I've used all types of programming languages including C, C++, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, MATLAB, Golang and probably some more I've missed! Check out my [LinkedIn](https://nz.linkedin.com/in/keeganjames0) if you'd like to learn more about my past professional experience.
